# HELP
Andrioid housing app developed at COSI 153A 2017.
<br />
Think of it as Yelp, but for housing. 
<br />
Note: Backend REST service and database connection at this [repository](https://github.com/dvilinsky/HousingApp).

## Motivation
Have you ever had a crummy landlord who didn't maintain the apartment, invaded your privacy, or stole your security deposit? How did you fight back against this? 
<br />
Chances are, you just moved, or perhaps tried to engage with the justice system. But then what? You move into another apartment, and you have no idea what to expect of the current landlord. So the cycle continues. You have almost no power in this situation.
<br />
To fight back against greedy landlords, and to better review what you're getting into when you rent an apartment, we introduced HELP. 
<br />
HELP is a crowdsourced landlord and apartment rating app. Think of it as Yelp, but for housing. Users will be able to rate landlords and apartments, creating a knowledge base accessible to the whole world

## Functionality
A user can search a user/apartment and find the best view. A user can login to rate reviews of a user/apartment. This app essentially works by being a yelp for houses/landlords. 

## Implementation
* Searching: ViewPager, Fragments,Tabs, filterable ListView 
* Slide show: ViewPager and Picasso API
